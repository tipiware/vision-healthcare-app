## vision-healthcare-app

This is a multipage healthcare website that serve for the purpose of raising eyecare awareness. This application was developed using react, nextjs, cghartjs, tailwindcss and redux. I dedicate this website to my father, whom suffer from retinal detachment. This is solely a landing page, which doesn't require services(data fetching, backend operation, etc) from backend.
